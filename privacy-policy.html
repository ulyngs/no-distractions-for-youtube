<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>I (Ulrik Lyngs) built `"No Distractions" for YouTube` as a Safari App Extension which does only this: hides recommended videos on the front page of YouTube, as well as the 'related videos' usually appearing in the right hand column when watching a video.</p>

<p>The extension collects zero data.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or suggestions, contact me at ulrik.lyngs@gmail.com.</p>
