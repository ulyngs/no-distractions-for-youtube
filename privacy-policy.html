<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>I (Ulrik Lyngs) built `"No Distractions" for YouTube` as a Safari App Extension that does only this: inject a style sheet and JavaScript content script on YouTube to allow you to hide distracting elements and save your preferred settings.</p>

<p>The extension collects zero data.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or suggestions, contact me at ulrik.lyngs@gmail.com.</p>
