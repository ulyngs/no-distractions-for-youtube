<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>I (Ulrik Lyngs) built `Hide distractions on YouTube` as a Safari Web Extension which does only this: hides recommended videos on the front page of YouTube, 'related videos' appearing when watching a video, and (on Mac and iPad) hides comments and adds a button that loads them when clicked/tapped.</p>

<p>The extension collects zero data.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or suggestions, contact me at ulrik.lyngs@gmail.com.</p>
